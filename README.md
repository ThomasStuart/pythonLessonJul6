Python Lesson July 6th Overview:

1. Quiz on Random library, ascii table, and string concatenation (15 – 20 min )

2. Review GeneratePasswords class (2-3 min)

3. Add the following to the GeneratePasswords class: (30-45 min)

A. GenerateXPasswords(…) # where X is a numeric amount
B. RatePasswordsAndSelectBest(…)
C. Refactor Code to account for edge cases

4. Solve questions: (1 hour)

B. Find a peak element

Given an array of integers. Find a peak element in it. An array element is a peak if it is NOT smaller than its neighbours. For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbour.

Example:

**Input:** array[]= {5, 10, 20, 15}

**Output:** 20

The element 20 has neighbours 10 and 15,

both of them are less than 20.

**Input:** array[] = {10, 20, 15, 2, 23, 90, 67}

**Output:** 20 or 90

The element 20 has neighbours 10 and 15,

both of them are less than 20, similarly 90 has neighbous 23 and 67.

C.) Extension of problem B. Find the longest peak.

5. Unit Testing or Sorting (rest of the class)
